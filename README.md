Type faster is one of many "sub 3-hour" projects in which I time myself to see how well I can develop a project form just an idea to a fully usable experience. This project took me exactly 2:49:22. The concept of the game is to type out the words that are racing across the screen before they fully cross. If a word crosses, you lose a heart. Lose 3 hearts and the game is over. My personal best is 39, Think you can beat that? Try it out for yourself!
